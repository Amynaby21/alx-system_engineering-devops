This is a file explaining the Shell basics exercice.
In this exercice, I create a directory with different files in it.
The first file is about displaying the current working directory, I used pwd command.
The second file lists the content of hte currrent working directory. This was done by using ls command.
To change from the current to the homme directory, I use cd ~home directory command.
For displaying the long format list with the hidden and the digit and IDs, ls -al command was used.
